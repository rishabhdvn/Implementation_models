# 🧠 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — Built From Scratch (NumPy Only)

This project implements a **vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** completely from scratch — using only **NumPy**.

The goal is to understand how RNNs actually work:

- how sequences are processed
- how memory flows from step to step
- how gradients train the model (Backpropagation Through Time)
- how text can be generated afterward

We train the model on a tiny string:

```
hello
```

The network learns to predict the next character.

## 📚 What is an RNN?

Normal neural networks assume inputs are **independent**.

But language, time-series, and audio have **order**:

```
h → e → l → l → o
```

So the meaning depends on what came before.

An RNN keeps a **hidden state (memory)** that is updated at each step.

### RNN formula

```
h_t = tanh(Wxh * x_t + Whh * h_{t-1} + bh)
y_t = softmax(Why * h_t + by)
```

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
x_t | current input (one-hot vector)
h_t | hidden state (memory)
Wxh | input → hidden weights
Whh | hidden → hidden (recurrent) weights
bh | hidden bias
Why | hidden → output weights
by | output bias

## 🔎 Step-by-step explanation

### 1️⃣ Data preparation

Convert characters → indices → one-hot vectors.

Example (`vocab_size = 4`):

```
'l' -> [0, 0, 1, 0]
```

---

### 2️⃣ Initialize weights

Weights start as **small random numbers**:

```python
Wxh = np.random.randn(hidden_size, vocab_size) * 0.01
```

Why small?

- prevents tanh from saturating
- keeps gradients stable early on

---

### 3️⃣ Forward pass

For every character:

1) mix input + previous memory  
2) apply tanh  
3) compute probabilities

```python
hs[t] = np.tanh(Wxh @ xs[t] + Whh @ hs[t-1] + bh)
ys[t] = Why @ hs[t] + by
ps[t] = softmax(ys[t])
```

---

### 4️⃣ Loss (how wrong the model is)

We use **cross-entropy**:

```
loss = -log(probability of correct character)
```

Big penalty if model is confident but wrong.

---

### 5️⃣ Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

We compute gradients:

- dWxh — input → hidden
- dWhh — recurrent
- dWhy — hidden → output
- dbh, dby — biases
- dh_next — gradient flowing backward through time

We also clip gradients to avoid exploding values.

---

### 6️⃣ Weight updates

Gradient Descent:

```
weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient
```

This slowly improves predictions.

---

### 7️⃣ Text generation

Start with a seed character and repeatedly:

1) compute hidden state  
2) sample next character  
3) feed it back in  

Eventually:

```
hello
```

(or close!)

## 🧪 What you learn here

- what hidden state actually is
- why RNNs can remember sequences
- how loss + gradients train the network
- what frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) do behind the scenes

---

## 🚀 Possible extensions

- add LSTM (forget + input gates)
- add GRU
- train on words instead of characters
- convert to PyTorch
- add batching

This project serves as the advanced "add-on" to standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While our previous RNN implementation was capable of handling simple sequence tasks, it suffered from a critical limitation known as the Vanishing Gradient Problem.The Problem with Standard RNNsIn a standard RNN, data is transformed at every single time step using a tanh activation.Short-term memory is good: It remembers the immediate past well.Long-term memory fails: As the sequence gets longer (e.g., a long paragraph), the gradients (signals used for learning) become smaller and smaller until they vanish. The network effectively "forgets" the beginning of the sequence by the time it reaches the end.The LSTM SolutionThis repository implements the solution: The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network.Instead of simply rewriting the memory at every step, the LSTM introduces a "Cell State" ($C_t$)—a protected memory highway that runs through the entire sequence.Key Upgrades in this Code:Gating Mechanisms: Unlike the RNN's single layer, this implementation adds three gates (Forget, Input, Output) to regulate information flow.Separate States: We now manage two state vectors:Hidden State (h): For immediate predictions.Cell State (C): For preserving long-term context.

If you want to build any of those, open an issue or try it yourself 🙂
